        <td style="width: 10%">Spike Rush mode</td>
        <td>
          Spike Rush mode, the match is played as best of 7 rounds - the first
          team to win 4 rounds wins the match. Players begin the round with all
          abilities fully charged except their ultimate, which charges twice as
          fast as in standard games. All players on the attacking team carry a
          spike, but only one spike may be activated per round. Guns are
          randomized in every round and every player begins with the same gun.
          Ultimate point orbs in the standard game are present, as well as
          multiple different power-up orbs

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Swiftplay</td>

        <td>
          Swiftplay matches are simply a shortened version of the Unrated game
          mode. 10 players are split into 2 teams, attackers and defenders.
          Attackers must plant the spike while the Defenders must stop them.
          What differs Swiftplay to Unrated is that it is best to 9 rounds - the
          first team to win 5 rounds wins the match. On round 4, the team's
          players switch, as they would do in round 7 in the Unrated game mode.
          The game's currency system has no changes from Unrated. Swiftplay is
          meant as a quick game mode, averaging around 15 minutes per game, as
          opposed to around 40 minutes for Unrated

      <td>Premier gamemode</td>
   <td>Premier is a 5v5 gamemode that allows players a path-to-pro competitive
    game mode that is aimed towards players that wish to be a professional
    player. Premier is currently in alpha testing in Brazil. Players will
    need to create a team of five to compete against other teams in
    divisions. Each season will last a few weeks and the top teams will be
    invited to compete in the Division Championship. This gamemode will
    include a pick-and-ban system for maps unlike all the other gamemodes
    where the players have to play the map selected by the system</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Deathmatch mode</td>
<td>The Deathmatch mode was introduced on August 5, 2020.[18] 14 players
    enter a 9-minute free-for-all match and the first person to reach 40
    kills or the player who has the most kills when time is up wins the
    match. Players spawn in with a random agent as well as full shields, and
    all abilities are disabled during the match which indulges pure gunplay.
    Green health packs drop on every kill, which reset the player to maximum
    health, armor, and give an additional 30 bullets to each of their guns</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Escalation gamemode</td>
<td>The Escalation gamemode was introduced on February 17, 2021[20] and is
    similar to the "gungame" concept found in Counter-Strike and Call of
    Duty: Black Ops, though it is team-based rather than free-for-all with 5
    players on each team. The game will pick a random selection of 12
    weapons to move through. As with other gungame versions, a team needs to
    get a certain number of kills to advance to the next weapon and the
    weapons get progressively worse as the team moves through them.[21]
    There are two winning conditions, if one team successfully goes through
    all 12 levels, or if one team is on a higher level than the opposing
    team within 10 minutes. Just like Deathmatch, players spawn in as a
    random agent, unable to use abilities, as the gamemode is set for pure
    gun fights. Though, abilities like Sova's shock darts, Raze's boom bot,
    and rocket launcher, are abilities that everyone gets to use as a
    weapon. After a kill, green health packs drop, which replenishes the
    player's health, armor, and ammo to its maximum. The gamemode also has
    auto respawns on, respawning players in random locations around the map</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Replication gamemode</td>
<td>The Replication gamemode went live on May 11, 2021.[23] During the agent
    select, players vote on which agent they would want to play as. At the
    end of the time, or after everyone has voted, the game randomly selects
    one of the player's votes. The entire team will then play as that agent,
    even if one of the players has not unlocked that agent. It is a best of
    nine, with the players switching sides after the fourth round. Players
    can buy guns and shields with a pre-set number of credits. Abilities are
    pre-bought. Weapons and shields are reset every round</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Snowball Fight</td>
<td> Snowball Fight is a limited-time gamemode that was released on December
    15, 2020, and is only available during Christmas season.[25] It is a
    Team Deathmatch game mode, with 50 kills to win. Abilities are not
    allowed to be used, and players spawn in as a random agent. The only
    weapon available is the snowball launcher, which is an instant kill, but
    slow, and uses a projectile-based arc. There is infinite ammo.
    Throughout the game a "portal" will spawn, delivering gifts, which each
    contain a random power up</td>

            on Attack or Defense, then swap to the other side for the next 12
            rounds. The first to 13 rounds wins (Bo25), with a final Endgame round
            played should the game reach a 12-12 scoreline</td>
