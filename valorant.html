      Valorant is a free-to-play team-based first-person shooter game developed
      and published by Riot Games. It was first released in June 2020 and is
      available for Microsoft Windows. Here are some key features and aspects of
      Valorant: Gameplay: Valorant combines elements of tactical shooters and
      hero-based gameplay. Two teams of five players compete against each other
      in matches where they take turns playing as attackers and defenders. The
      objective varies depending on the game mode but often involves planting or
      defusing a spike (bomb) or eliminating the opposing team. Agents: In
      Valorant, players can choose from a diverse roster of agents, each with
      unique abilities and playstyles. Agents belong to different classes such
      as Duelists, Controllers, Initiators, and Sentinels. Their abilities can
      be used strategically to gain advantages in combat, gather information, or
      control the battlefield. Weapons: Valorant offers a wide range of weapons,
      including rifles, pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, and heavy weapons.
      Players earn in-game currency during matches, which can be used to
      purchase weapons, armor, and abilities. Tactical Gameplay: Valorant
      emphasizes tactical gameplay, where teamwork, communication, and precise
      aim are crucial for success. The game encourages strategic planning, map
      control, and coordinated execution of strategies. Ranked Mode: Valorant
      features a competitive ranked mode where players can test their skills and
      climb the ranks. By winning matches and earning rating points, players can
      progress through various ranks and divisions, showcasing their skill
      level. Maps: Valorant currently offers a variety of maps, each with unique
      layouts and objectives. Players need to learn the maps' intricacies,
      callouts, and optimal strategies to maximize their performance. Updates
      and Esports: Riot Games regularly updates Valorant, introducing new
      content such as agents, maps, and gameplay improvements. Additionally,
      Valorant has gained popularity in the esports scene, with professional
      tournaments and leagues organized worldwide. It's important to note that
      the information provided is based on the game as of my knowledge cutoff in
      September 2021. Since then, there may have been new agents, maps, and
      gameplay changes introduced to the game. For the most up-to-date
      information, I recommend visiting the official Valorant website or
      consulting recent sources dedicated to the game.
